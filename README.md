# Smart Parking System
C++ Project assignment for UTP course **Structured Programming (TEB1013)**
_ _ _

# Project Description
This is a console-based Smart Parking System developed using C++ as part of the **TEB1013 Structured Programming** course at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP).  
The system is designed to manage parking slots efficiently for students and staff, featuring ID-based access, real-time slot updates and a stylized text UI for showcasing the parking availability.

# Features
- **Slot Availability Check** – Only allows entry if a slot is available
- **Real-Time Grid Display** – Visual layout with slots `P1` to `P16` (4x4)
- **User ID-Based Entry/Exit** – Prevents double entries; tracks usage
- **Stylized CLI Interface** – Clear and user-friendly text-based design
- **Input Validation** – Prevents invalid or duplicate operations

# C++ Concepts Used
- `struct` – to store user and slot details  
- `array` – 2D array to represent parking grid  
- `functions` – modular structure with reusable logic  
- `vector` – dynamic storage of users  
- `text formatting` – for clear UI presentation  
- `file handling (optional)` – for logs and future enhancement

# Future Development Ideas 
- Admin mode with password
- Parking fee calculation (based on duration)
- RFID or barcode scanner simulation
- Load/save data on program restart
